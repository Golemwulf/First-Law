          <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            The end is coming. Logen Ninefingers might only have one more fight in him â€“ but it's going to 
            be a big one. Battle rages across the North, the King of the Northmen still stands firm, and 
            there's only one man who can stop him. His oldest friend, and his oldest enemy: it's time for 
            the Bloody-Nine to come home. With too many masters and too little time, Superior Glokta is 
            fighting a different kind of war. A secret struggle in which no one is safe, and no one can be 
            trusted. As his trials with the Inquisition grow ever more urgent, he learns that the world is 
            more corrupt than he could have ever dreamed. And who knows who the real traitors are? 
            King Jezal dan Luthar, the once-feckless playboy, finds he likes being King. He soon learns, 
            though, that the throne isn't always so easy to hold onto. Meanwhile, the First of the Magi, 
            Bayaz, is manipulating events from behind the scenes. But with the Gurkish army drawing ever closer, 
            even the mighty Bayaz's plan might not be enough to save the Union.
